What is Abuse Helper

Abuse Helper is toolkit for CERT and Abuse teams. 
It is a modular, (hopefully) scalable and robust 
framework to help you in your abuse handling.
Grandfather: AutoReporter (CERT-FI)
Father: AbuseKiller (CERT-EE)
Son: Abuse Helper (CERT-EE, CERT-FI with the Community)
Distant cousin: AISI
With Abuse Helper you can:

Retrieve Internet Abuse Handling related information via 
several sources which are near-real-time (such as IRC)
periodic (such as Email reports), or request/resnponse 
(such as HTTP).  You can then aggregate that information 
based on different keys, such as AS numbers or country codes
Sent out reports in different formats, via different 
transports and using different timings 

Abuse Helper features include:

Fully modular (you can utilize different readers, parsers, 
transports, splitters, combiners in a pipe-like manner)
Scalable: you can distribute the work to different machines 
and different geolocations Observable: you can use your 
favourite XMPP client to observe the bots at work

Prerequisites

Python 2.5
We've worked hard not to introduce any additional dependencies. If your distro does not have python 2.5 yet, you should be able just to compile and install python 2.5.
Some bots might require CouchDB 0.9
Ejabberd XMPP server
